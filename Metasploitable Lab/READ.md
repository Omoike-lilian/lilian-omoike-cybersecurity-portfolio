#  Metasploitable Vulnerability Assessment

##  Project Overview
This project involved conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a **Metasploitable 2** server ‚Äî a deliberately vulnerable Linux machine used for penetration testing and security training.  
The goal was to identify and document **critical security flaws** mapped to frameworks such as **CIS Controls**, **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, and **OWASP Top 10**.

The assessment simulated a real-world enterprise audit workflow ‚Äî from reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery to reporting and remediation planning.


##  Objectives
- Identify critical and high-risk vulnerabilities across network and web layers.  
- Map each finding to applicable controls (CIS, NIST CSF).  
- Recommend prioritized remediation and risk mitigation strategies.  
- Strengthen practical experience in vulnerability assessment, reporting, and risk communication.


##  Tools & Methodology
| Phase | Tools Used | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Discovery & Enumeration | **Nmap** | Port scanning, service detection, OS identification |
| Web Assessment | **Nikto** | Detect misconfigurations, outdated components, missing headers |
| Vulnerability Mapping | **Nuclei** | Automated CVE template scanning, confirmation of known exploits |
| Reporting | **Excel / Markdown / Word** | Consolidated results, risk matrix, and executive summary |


##  Key Findings (Summary)
| Category | Example Vulnerability | CVE / Reference | Severity | Framework Mapping |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Remote Code Execution** | vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor | CVE-2011-2523 | üî¥ Critical | CIS 7.1, NIST PR.IP-1 |
| **Data Exposure** | Cleartext Transmission (Telnet/FTP) | - | üî¥ High | NIST PR.DS-2 |
| **Weak Authentication** | Default Credentials (SSH, MySQL) | - | üî¥ High | CIS 5.2 |
| **Outdated Components** | Apache 2.2.x, Samba 3.x | Multiple CVEs | üü† High | CIS 7.1 |
| **Information Disclosure** | phpinfo.php, Directory Listing | - | üü° Medium | CIS 9.2, OWASP A5 |


##  Risk Summary
| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Total Findings** | 14 vulnerabilities identified |
| **Critical / High** | 8 vulnerabilities requiring immediate remediation |
| **Frameworks Referenced** | CIS Controls v8, NIST CSF, OWASP Top 10 |
| **Business Impact** | Risk of system compromise, data theft, or lateral network intrusion |


##  Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Isolation** ‚Äì Disconnect the vulnerable host from the network until remediated.  
2. **Patch Management** ‚Äì Upgrade vsFTPd, Apache, Samba, MySQL, and related dependencies.  
3. **System Hardening** ‚Äì Disable Telnet, enforce SSH-only remote access, use encrypted protocols.  
4. **Access Controls** ‚Äì Enforce strong authentication and rotate default credentials.  
5. **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Äì Implement a SIEM (e.g., Wazuh, Splunk) to detect unauthorized access attempts.  
6. **Verification Scan** ‚Äì Conduct follow-up assessment after remediation to validate closure.

##  Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of **vulnerability management lifecycle** ‚Äî discovery, prioritization, remediation, and validation.  
- Hands-on application of **offensive and defensive security principles**.  
- Improved ability to translate technical findings into **business risk language**.  
- Reinforced **reporting and documentation** skills for audit-ready deliverables.
