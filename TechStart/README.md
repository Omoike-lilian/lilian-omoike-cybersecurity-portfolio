TechStart Solutions – Enterprise Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan
Overview

This project simulates the role of a GRC Analyst performing a comprehensive risk assessment for TechStart Solutions, a mid-sized fintech company with 150 employees across three locations.
The assessment identifies, analyzes, and proposes mitigations for key cybersecurity risks affecting operations, compliance, and data integrity.

 Objectives

Conduct a risk assessment using NIST and ISO 27005 principles.

Develop a risk register documenting 10 major risks.

Apply quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine risk levels.

Recommend mitigation strategies and assign controls.

Align findings with NIST CSF and CIS Controls.

 Methodology

Risk Identification – Gathered data from incident reports and system audits.

Risk Analysis – Evaluated likelihood and impact using a 5x5 matrix.

Framework Mapping – Applied NIST CSF categories: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

Risk Treatment – Proposed mitigation actions (avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept).

Documentation – Created a risk register and executive summary.

Key Risks Identified
Risk	Description	   Likelihood	   Impact	    Risk     Level	     Framework
Phishing Attacks	Users falling for fake login prompts	High	High	Critical	NIST PR.AT-1
Unauthorized Admin Access	Poor access control policies	Medium	High	High	CIS 5.2
Unpatched Servers	Missing updates for key systems	High	High	Critical	NIST PR.IP-12
Backup Failure	No verified recovery process	Medium	High	High	NIST RC.BC-1
Data Breach Risk	Sensitive client data exposure	Medium	Critical	High	ISO 27001 A.8
 Recommended Mitigation Actions

Implement MFA and Conditional Access (Entra ID) for admin users.

Enforce patch management policy across all endpoints.

Establish a business continuity plan with regular backup validation.

Provide security awareness training for employees.

Conduct quarterly risk reviews to track residual risk levels.

Tools & Frameworks Used

Microsoft Excel (Risk Register & Matrix)

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

ISO 27005

CIS Critical Security Controls

Risk Scoring (Qualitative + Quantitative)

Executive Summary

The assessment revealed high exposure to phishing, patch management, and data access risks, which could result in business disruption and financial losses.
The implementation of security awareness programs, MFA, and automated patching is expected to reduce the overall risk exposure by up to 60%.
